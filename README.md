# AgainstTheVirus
 AR experiences using Spark AR

Against the Virus is an AR effect that I’ve made using Spark AR from Facebook. This is about the discovery of a hole that turned out to be a den of viruses.
We need to attach the virus by tapping the virus on our screen phone. The intention for this AR effect is to remind us to fight current pandemic situations, to be strong and always be on one's guard to stay safe and healthy.

What are the components that I’ve used on this?
I’ve made World AR and included some patches inside. There are “Loop Animation” combining with “Transition” to animate the position of the object, “Object Tap” for detecting our input to the 3D object and 2D object, Added new feature from SparkAR version 91, “3D Text”. Also “Particle System” for the smoke effects from the hole. And some other patches that I’ve used for the animations.

This AR effect currently still in development, will see more probabilities that can be added as the function to make this more interesting.
